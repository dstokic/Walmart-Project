        <h1>Why the Addition of Augmented Reality?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="descrip">
        <p>The globe is still in the aftershock of a pandemic and because of this, online and minimal-contact shopping is becoming more commonplace. Brands everywhere are beginning to integrate AR (Augmented Reality) in order to provide customers a more typical experience, such as testing out products, from the safety of their own homes.</p>
        <p>Online shopping typically comes with a higher risk than shopping in-store as customers must imagine what a product will look like which rarely lines up with the product's true function or feel. This leads to unsatisfied customers and an overall frustrating experience.</p>
        <p>AR provides an effective solution to that issue as the customer would be able to see what makeup would look like on their faces, how furniture would look in their own home, or how clothes would fit them specifically. This provides a more unique shopping experience for the customer while also lessening frustrations surrounding risky online purchases.</p>

        <h1>AR Online</h1>
        <p>The main use case of augmented reality online is to provide the customer a chance to get a better idea of what a product would look like in their everyday life. The inclusion of augmented reality online leads to an overall less risky purchase for the customer and an increased likelihood of them returning to the store for later purchases.</p>

      <div class="in-store module">
        <h1>AR In-Store</h1>
        <p>While including augmented reality online is an obvious addition, incorporating augmented reality technology in-store could be just as beneficial to the customer. Something like a mirror that utilizes AR in clothing sections would allow people to see what clothing looks like on them without going to a changing room. A similar style AR mirror could be used in makeup sections which would provide a relatively accurate portrayal of what certain products look like without needing to find and test those products themselves. Overall, something like this would lead towards a more streamlined and positive shopping experience for the customer.</p>
